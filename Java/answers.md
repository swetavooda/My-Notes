* first have package then import statements.
* finilize garbage colector(might or might not)
* indentifier cant start with *
* instance variable have default value,local variable throw complilation error if not initializes.
* static initializers -
* instance initializer without any name {} //called becore constructor
* after calling jvm static initializers are called;
* local variable should be initialized
* int a = 1_0 //valid a=10;
* wrapping around byte 1_2_8;assignment operator activated during runtime only.
* private constructors and instace initialiser
* static initialiser - as soon as the class is loaded( after finding the class first puting in jvm)
 we cant have instance initialiser inside a method.
order
1) static initialiser
2) instance initialiser



1) final method cannot be overriden
2) instance variables need not be initialised but local variables are supposed to be initialised
3) if(b2=true) [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7883502/false-boolean-true]
4) constructors can be called only using this inside a constructor
5) super should be first line on the constructor
6) interfaces [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interfaces-in-java/]
interfaces varibles - public,static,final
methods - abstract, public
from java8 we can have 
	* static methods(these are not inherited)
	* method implementation
	* cant have constructors
7) abstract classes
    * they can have constructors
    * they can have implementation
    * 



* abstract class
* what happens when u terminate a class def with semicolon.
* null pointer exception
* creating an instance of class contained by main
* Object type
* super.super.Print()

* interfaces and abstarct classes
* packages
* wrapping around
